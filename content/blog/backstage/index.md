* Really wanted to use github, but also really wanted to get this thing deployed
* Approvals were all backwards from the CBO. The account was created before the cost was approved. Needed to backfill the request.
* Fargate platform is great, very cool solution. But MAN is it annoying
  * Virtually no customization
  * Documentation is all over the place
  * How do I even add a database?
  * Did I make a huge mistake? I feel like I could have done this myself by now.

* Getting this account set up is a disaster. More like we're a disaster. It's a wheel of pain.
  * To get an account, you have to submit a request to CBO
  * To get onboarded to fargate platform, CE needs to add core resources (networking, IAM roles)
  * To get CE to review it, it needs to be reviewed by InfoSec.
    * Before you get there, you need to be chastised for naming conventions you didn't pick and get harassed over development strategies.
